## About

CMITS is a simple, interactive system that lets you register contributors, log issues, and generate project reports — all from the terminal. It demonstrates core Python concepts including tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, file I/O, and input validation.

---

## Features

-  Register up to **4 contributors** with name, role, language, commits, and country
-  Log up to **5 issues** with type, priority, reporter, and status
-  Robust **input validation** — rejects invalid entries and re-prompts cleanly
-  Automatic **project report** generation
-  **Urgent issue detection** using list
-  **Final summary** printed to the terminal
